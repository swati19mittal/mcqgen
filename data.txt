Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.

Additional Types:

Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. 
Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Itâ€™s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
